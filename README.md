# Intro to Coding

This is a series of simple tasks/demos for a range of languages to learn. 
All of the tasks may not relate to all of the langauges but provides a basis to demonstrate the basic syntatx for the languages of interest.
This also provides a central reference point for basic langauge syntax, not that this is specifically needed for the public but is an activity that is personally useful.

These tasks are:
1. Langauge setup and virtual environments
2. "Hello World!"
3. Importing functions/classes
4. Write functions, classes, and modules 
5. Read and write to disk
6. Linear regression
7. Plotting

Using Sphinx the documentation of this process (and the _Read the Docs_ theme) provides a means to improve domumentation skills and to ease the access to the demos/reference material developed in this repo.
The languages of interest here are:
- C/C++ (general purpose)
- JavaScript (web apps and client/server management)
- Julia (statistical computing)
- Python (general purpose)
- R (statistical computing)
- Scala (general purpose)
- SQL/Redshift (database querying)
